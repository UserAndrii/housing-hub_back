# HOUSING-HUB System Backend

This repository contains the base code for the advertisement system. It provides
RESTful API endpoints for managing users, fetching an array of advertisements,
and posting a new advertisement. Further manipulations with advertisements are
implemented subsequently. The technologies used include Node.js, Express.js,
Cloudinary, MongoDB, and other middleware and libraries.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user and car information.
- Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads (used for car photos).
- Cloudinary: Cloud storage for storing car photos.
- Swagger-jsdoc and Swagger-ui-express: Used for API documentation.
- Cors: Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- Morgan: Middleware for logging HTTP requests.
- Dotenv: Used for loading environment variables from a .env file.
- Joi: A library for data validation.
- UUID: Used for generating unique identifiers.
